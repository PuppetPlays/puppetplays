```

## Deployment Process

The deployment process is handled by CircleCI, which builds Docker images and deploys them to the appropriate environment based on the branch:
- `develop` branch deploys to staging
- `master` branch deploys to production

### Manual Deployment

1. SSH into the server

2. Copy the deployment files to the server:
   ```bash
   scp -r puppetplays-deploy user@server:/path/to/deploy
   ```

3. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

## Database Backups

The `scripts/db-backup.sh` script handles automatic database backups. It can be configured as a cron job:

```bash
# Add to crontab to run daily at 1 AM
0 1 * * * /path/to/puppetplays-deploy/scripts/db-backup.sh daily
```

Backups are stored in:
```
${PUPPETPLAYS_HOST_DIR}/database/postgres-backups/daily/
```

## Server Configuration

Server Nginx configuration files are provided in the `nginx/` directory. These should be:
1. Copied to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`
2. Symlinked to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`
3. Verified with `nginx -t`
4. Applied with `systemctl reload nginx`

For detailed server configuration information, refer to the [Server Configuration Documentation](../puppetplays-docs/3-Configuration-serveur.md).
